# Contributing

First, thank you for considering contributing to SCSS Starter! It's people like you that make the open source community such a great community!

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Using the issue tracker

## Bug Reports

Before reporting a bug report:

1. \*\*Validate and lint your code -- [validate your HTML](https://html5.validator.nu/) to ensure your problem isn't caused by a simple error in your own code.
2. \*\*Use the GitHub issue search -- check if the issue has already been reported.
3. \*\*Check if the issue has been fixed â€” try to reproduce it using the latest master branch in the repository.
4. \*\*Isolate the problem -- ideally create a [reduced test case](https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) and a live example. You may use [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) to show the problem.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> `<url>` - a link to the reduced test case
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their merits).

Great Bug Reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce

  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can

- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS experience the problem? Do other browsers show the bug differently? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

## Pull requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

3. Run `yarn` to download required packages.
4. Run `yarn build` to build.
5. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
6. Make sure your code lints.(`yarn lint`)
