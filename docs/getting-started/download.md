SCSS Starter is not a package, but a boilerplate. Therefore, we recommend downloading the `scss` folder into your project.

You can [download](https://github.com/atolye15/scss-starter/releases) it directly or clone it as follows;

```bash
git clone git@github.com:atolye15/scss-starter.git
```

> All you need is the `scss` folder, feel free to delete other files.
