SCSS Starter is a boilerplate with CSS-resets, standard [variables](core/variables.md), common [functions](core/functions.md) and [mixins](core/mixins.md) to kickstart CSS authoring. It also has built-in [utility](utilities/predefined-classes.md) and [grid](layout/grid.md) systems.

It's designed especially for higher productivity and code quality resulting in cleaner, maintainable and scalable code.

We have provided detailed documentation to help new users to get started. We are always open to any feedback and we'd be happy to answer any questions a user may have about SCSS Starter.

## Why It's Awesome

We have been using SCSS starter kit internally for a while now and developing it based on the needs of projects that vary in size.

Because;

- It has a solid base built upon [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) to fix cross-browser compatibility issues.
- It has built-in utility and grid systems.
- It has well designed [architecture](getting-started/architecture.md).
- It has supportive mixins & functions.
- Every part of SCSS Starter can be customized based on your project's needs including variables, utilities, a grid system, etc.
- It is extremely easy to build responsive interfaces without extra effort. All utility classes and a grid system can be extended with responsive variants.
- Because SCSS Starter doesn't have any styles other than basic things, it does not conflict with your own styles.
- Utilities, mixins and functions can be extended if needed.

## Browser Support

SCSS Starter supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers and platforms. On Windows, we support Microsoft Edge. It does not use any tool for browser support. Using autoprefixer for browser support is up to you.
