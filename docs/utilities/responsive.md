Some of utility classes can be applied conditionally at different breakpoints, which makes it a piece of cake to build complex responsive interfaces without ever leaving your HTML.

The classes are named using the format `.u-{class-name}@{breakpoint}-{up|down}`.

> It should be noted here, that when we write `up` or `down`, this includes the breakpoint itself. For example the utility class `.u-display-none@md-down` would work only at the breakpoint `md` and below.
